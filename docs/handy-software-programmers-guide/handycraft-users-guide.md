## What It Is and What It Will Be

*Handycraft* is a Handy image manipulation program. *Handycraft*'s 3 main areas of capability are:

- Handy image scaling preview and manipulation, especially in being able to create a table that drives Scale-3 scaling
- Handy sprite image data creation, including finding the best (most compressed) way to write out the data
- Handy display emulator

*Handycraft* may also become a mini art editor and animation tool. Also, *Handycraft* will one day allow a file of sprite data to be created using only command-line arguments, without requiring the programmer/artist to create a display, paste the art, and then create the data file.

After a while, each programmer will have real Handy hardware at his or her own desk, and so the display emulation capability of Handy will become unnecessary and will finally be removed from the program.

If you run out of memory, try exiting all tools and then rebooting your system. Often the Amiga looks like it has enough memory left but various programs don't behave well and leave memory fragmented, which impedes Handycraft as it sometimes needs large blocks of contiguous memory.
